MultiplelineEllipsizeTextView
==========================

In Android, the default TextView does not support ellipsize for multiple lines text. So if a user needs this feature, he/she needs to write a customized TextView.

The initial version comes from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2160619/android-ellipsize-multiline-textview. But there is only support for ellipsize END. Here I also add the support for START and MIDDLE.
